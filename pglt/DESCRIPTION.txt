pG-lt (or phyloGenerator-light) is a pipeline for the automated generation of
phylogenies through `Mass Phylogeny Estimation`. It is adapted from
phyloGenerator (C) 2013 and was written by D.J. Bennett with additional help
from W.D. Pearse and L. Hudson.

It makes use of external programs for phylogeny generation and bioinformatics,
these are: RAxML (Copyright (C) Stamatakis 2013), MAFFT (Copyright (C) 2013
Kazutaka Katoh) NCBI's standalone BLAST suite 2.2.29+ and online API services
(Copyright NCBI (C) 2009). It also uses the following python packages:
Biopython (Copyright Cook (C) 2009), Dendropy (Copyright Sukumaran and Holder
(C) 2010) and Taxon Names Resovler (Copyright (C) Bennett 2014).
